# Random-Forest-Regression
Implemented Random Forest Regression to model and predict target values based on a mix of numerical and categorical features. Handled preprocessing using Label Encoding and combined feature sets for model training. Achieved robust predictions with optimized parameters and evaluated model using out-of-bag (OOB) score.
